# BGPGuard

Web application of the BGP Anomaly Detection Framework.
###### Python 3.6

The web-based version of **BGPGuard** offers 
an interactive interface with a better view for monitoring and performing experiments. 
The web-based application includes several functions from the terminal-based application.
It is developed using additional programming languages, frameworks, and functions.
Its front-end is built based on HTML, CSS ([Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com): an open-source CSS framework), 
and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io) (a transport protocol written in a JavaScript for real-time web applications).
Its back-end is developed using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x) 
(a micro web framework written in Python).

The `src` directory contains the source code for the real-time detection and off-line classification tasks.
Various Python functions have been developed to implement and incorporate the anomaly detection steps.

## External Libraries
The web-based application relies on additional external libraries. 
The external CSS and JavaScript libraries provided by [_jsDelivr_](https://www.jsdelivr.com) have been 
included in `layout.html`.

The Python libraries installed by [_pip_](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) are:
- [_NumPy_](https://numpy.org): used to perform mathematical operations 
on multi-dimensional arrays and on matrices generated during the process.
- [_SciPy_](https://scipy.org): dependency of the _scikit-learn_ library. 
_SciPy_'s _zscore_: function used to perform normalization.
- [_scikit-learn_](https://scikit-learn.org/stable)}: employed for processing data and calculating performance metrics.
- [_PyTorch_](https://pytorch.org): used for developing deep learning models.

- [_Flask_](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x): web framework based on _Werkzeug_
and _Jinja_.
(The _Flask_'s functions are used to transfer variables and render web pages. 
_Flask_ also processes the GET/POST requests from the front-end.)
- [_Werkzeug_](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x): web application library used to 
create a web server gateway interface (WSGI).
- [_Jinja_](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x): web template engine. Variables, statements, 
and expressions allowed to include in HTML files. 
- [_Flask-SocketIO_](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest): offers bi-directional communications 
with low latency between the clients (front-end) and the server (back-end) for _Flask_ applications.
- [_python-engineio_](https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest): implementation of the Engine.IO in Python. 
- [_python-socketio_](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/python-engineio): library for real-time communication 
between client and server based on WebSocket. 
- [_Eventlet_](https://eventlet.net): networking library for executing asynchronous tasks.

## Install the external Python libraries by running:

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## The C# compiler should be installed prior to executing the BGP C# tool.
- [_Mono_](https://www.mono-project.com): an open source version of Microsoft .NET framework. 
Mono includes a C# compiler for several operating systems 
such as macOS, Linux, and Windows.

The Python file `app.py` is used to execute the application.
The following command is used to start the application:

```bash
> export FLASK_APP=app.py
> export FLASK_ENV=development
> flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## Playground
Sample code for gradient boosting machines may be run without launching the `app.py`:
```bash
./src/playground/gbdt_offline_sample
```
